#### Description

For this web map I decided to highlight the number of parks in Cary, NC, that feature different sports. Cary is a very sports centered town and despite not being a major city still hosts two professional soccer clubs both mens and womens. Cary also is a largely residential town with numerous schools. Because of these facts the town has a high density of recreation parks and sports fields. For my map I chose to keep the basemap light so that the icons can stand out more. I added the legend to the top right and the scale bar to the top left right under the main title of the map.
